## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability in our application, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Steps to report a vulnerability:

Do not discuss the vulnerability in public, including via public GitHub issues.

Send a description of the vulnerability directly to our security team at raideone@gmail.com.

Try to include as much information as possible, but at least:
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Screenshots can be very helpful.
- The application version in which you found the vulnerability.
- Any potential impacts of the vulnerability.

We will keep you informed of our progress as we work to address the vulnerability.
