# Contributing to MicroScore
There are multiple ways to contribute to this project:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If needed, update the readme
3. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/SuperYellowSystem/MicroScore/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]() it's that easy!
