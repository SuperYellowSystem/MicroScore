# µScore

µScore is an application for calculating your score for guild bosses and golems in the Mobile Legends Adventure game produced by Moonton.

µScore is compatible with Android version from Nougat(7) to Tiramisu(13)

## How does it work?
The application takes a screenshot when you press the "Abacadabra" button. From this capture, an image search is launched and, via optical recognition (OCR), the numbers are extracted from the capture and then used to calculate your score.

## Is the software safe?
Yes, the images obtained via screen capture are neither saved nor sent anywhere. If you don't trust me, you can always analyse the code and build the apk yourself.

## Can Moonton ban my account if I use this application?
Normally not. Unlike auto-clickers (widely used and tolerated by Moonton), µScore does not produce any user action. Consequently, Moonton should not be able to detect the use of the application. However, you're never safe.
